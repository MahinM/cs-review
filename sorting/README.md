###Sorting Algorithms

#####Bubble sort
Loop through array and compare each index with the index next to it.  If the two numbers are out of order, swap the two numbersâ€™ places in the array.  Keep looping until nothing was swapped during the last iteration.  
Best: O(n). Average: O(n<sup>2</sup>). Worst O(n<sup>2</sup>).
